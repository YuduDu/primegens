# INSTRUCTION
#
# select algorithm type for primer design. currenly four types of 
# algorithm design is available that is PSPD, FSPD, GSPD and SSPD.
#
# SSPD(Sequence-Specific Primer Design) (default) 
#	The algorithm is used to design primer for user input query
#	sequences in FASTA format. It will design primer for each 
#	sequenc and will check for hybridization for each pair.
#
# FSPD(Fragment-Specific Primer Design)
#	The algorithm would generate the fragment for each of the long 
#	query sequences based on fragment length (FSPD_LENGTH) and 
#	inter-distance between two fragments(FSPD_PERIOD).  
#
# GSPD(Gene-Specific Primer Design) 
#	The algorithm would use a list of input gene symbols to find 
#	respective nucleotide sequences from the database and generate 
#	primers. Algorithm assumes every gene symbols is present in 
#	the database.
#
# PSPD(Probe-Specific Primer Design)
#	The algorithm would first find the input unique fragment (probe) 
#	for a sequence amongst its homologs using multiple sequence 
#	alignment technique and generate primer for each sequence.

#ALGORITHM_TYPE=1			#Sequnce-specific primer design
#ALGORITHM_TYPE=2			#Fragment-specific primer design
#ALGORITHM_TYPE=3			#Gene-specific primer design
#ALGORITHM_TYPE=4			#Probe-specific primer design

ALGORITHM_TYPE=1			#Sequnce-specific primer design

##############-QUERY SEQUENCE INPUT FORMAT TYPE####################
# This tag represents title of the input query sequence. Program 
# would parse this title to fetch the coordinate of the sequence in 
# case of chromosome type database. Title follows the following 
# format chr22:10900-109500 "description" Incase parsing the title.

#QUERY_FORMAT=1			#FASTA:gid
#QUERY_FORMAT=2			#FASTA:gid,description
#QUERY_FORMAT=3			#FASTA:chr,start,end
#QUERY_FORMAT=4			#FASTA:chr,start,end,desciption

QUERY_FORMAT=3			#FASTA:gid

# This tag represents the presence/absence of nucleotide sequence 
# in a query and must follow same rule for each of them. If 
# nucleotide sequence is not present, program would either fetch 
# the sequence from database or genome by parsing the sequence title. 

#QUERY_SEQUENCE=0	#only query name present in query input
#QUERY_SEQUENCE=1	#nucleotide sequence present in query input

QUERY_SEQUENCE=1	#nucleotide sequence present in query input

##############DATABASE TYPE#############################################
# if database is in a single file, which contains multiple sequences,
# whether small or large, the database is classified as a single database.

# if database is genome of any species such that, each chromosome sequence
# is contained in one file like downloaded human genome then database type 
# is classified as chromosome type. 

# if there are multiple database, each file contains multiple sequences in
# FASTA format, then these database types are classified as multiple type.
# To Use this option, user  to generate a file containg list of names for 
# each database file.

#DATABASE_TYPE=1			#single database file
#DATABASE_TYPE=2			#multiple databases
#DATABASE_TYPE=3			#chromosomal sequences of organism

DATABASE_TYPE=1				#single database file

####################PRIMEGENS CONFIGURATION##############################
#Bisulfite mode primer design is for methylated type sequence primer design.
#Value of 1 indicates bisulfite mode primer design. If a value of 1 is
#entered then PRIMER_CG_MAX tag should have some value (default=0).

#______________PRIMER DESIGN PARAMETERS___________________________

# primer design parameters used specifically by primer3

# PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE=150-170
# The associated values specify the lengths of the product that 
# the user wants the primers to create, and is a space separated 
# list of elements of the form <x>-<y> where an <x>-<y> pair is 
# a legal range of lengths for the product.  For example, if one 
# wants PCR products to be between 100 to 150 bases (inclusive) 
# then one would set this parameter to 100-150.  

PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE=150-250


# PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG=0 (boolean, default 0)
# If this flag is non-0, produce PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN, 
# PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN, and PRIMER_INTERNAL_OLIGO_EXPLAIN output 
# tags, which are intended to provide information on the number 
# of oligos and primer pairs that primer3 examined, and statistics 
# on the number discarded for various reasons.  If -format_output 
# is set similar information is produced in the user-oriented output.

PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG=0


# PRIMER_FILE_FLAG=0 (boolean, default 0)
# If the associated value is non-0, then primer3 creates two output 
# files for each input SEQUENCE. File <sequence_id>.for lists all 
# acceptable left primers for <sequence_id>, and <sequence_id>.rev
# lists all acceptable right primers for <sequence_id>, where 
# <sequence_id> is the value of the PRIMER_SEQUENCE_ID tag (which 
# must be supplied).  In addition, if the input tag 
# PRIMER_PICK_INTERNAL_OLIGO is non-0, primer3 produces a file 
# <sequence_id>.int, which lists all acceptable internal oligos.

PRIMER_FILE_FLAG=0


# PRIMER_NUM_RETURN=5 (int, default 5)
# The maximum number of primer pairs to return.  Primer pairs 
# returned are sorted by their "quality", in other words by the 
# value of the objective function (where a lower number indicates 
# a better primer pair).  Caution: setting this parameter to a 
# large value will increase running time.

PRIMER_NUM_RETURN=25


# PRIMER_MAX_POLY_X (int, default 5)
# The maximum allowable length of a mononucleotide repeat, 
# for example AAAAAA.

PRIMER_MAX_POLY_X=0


#primer3-parameter

PRIMER_INTERNAL_OLIGO_MAX_POLY_X=0


# PRIMER_MIN_TM (float, default 57.0C)
# Minimum acceptable melting temperature(Celsius) for a primer oligo.

PRIMER_MIN_TM=56.0


# PRIMER_OPT_TM (float, default 60.0C)
# Optimum melting temperature(Celsius) for a primer oligo. 
# Primer3 will try to pick primers with melting temperatures are 
# close to this temperature.  The oligo melting temperature 
# formula used can be specified by user. Please see 
# PRIMER_TM_SANTALUCIA for more information.

PRIMER_OPT_TM=60.0


# PRIMER_MAX_TM (float, default 63.0C)
# Maximum acceptable melting temperature(Celsius) for a primer oligo.

PRIMER_MAX_TM=66.0


# PRIMER_OPT_SIZE (int, default 20)
# Optimum length (in bases) of a primer oligo. Primer3 will 
# attempt to pick primers close to this length.

PRIMER_OPT_SIZE=20


# PRIMER_MIN_SIZE (int, default 18)
# Minimum acceptable length of a primer.  Must be greater than 0 
# and less than or equal to PRIMER_MAX_SIZE.

PRIMER_MIN_SIZE=19


# PRIMER_MAX_SIZE (int, default 27)
# Maximum acceptable length (in bases) of a primer.  Currently 
# this parameter cannot be larger than 35. This limit is governed 
# by maximum oligo size for which primer3's melting-temperature 
# is valid.

PRIMER_MAX_SIZE=23


# PRIMER_MAX_GC (float, default 80.0%)
# Maximum allowable percentage of Gs and Cs in any primer 
# generated by Primer.

PRIMER_MAX_GC=60


# PRIMER_MIN_GC (float, default 20.0%)
# Minimum allowable percentage of Gs and Cs in any primer.

PRIMER_MIN_GC=40


# PRIMER_SELF_END (decimal 9999.99, default 3.00)
# The maximum allowable 3'-anchored global alignment score 
# when testing a single primer for self-complementarity, and the 
# maximum allowable 3'-anchored global alignment score when 
# testing for complementarity between left and right primers.  
# The 3'-anchored global alignment score is taken to predict the 
# likelihood of PCR-priming primer-dimers.

PRIMER_SELF_END=3


# PRIMER_SELF_ANY (decimal,9999.99, default 8.00)
# The maximum allowable local alignment score when testing a single 
# primer for (local) self-complementarity and the maximum allowable 
# local alignment score when testing for complementarity between 
# left and right primers.  Local self-complementarity is taken to 
# predict the tendency of primers to anneal to each other 
# without necessarily causing self-priming in the PCR.  The scoring 
# system gives 1.00 for complementary bases, -0.25 for a match of 
# any base (or N) with an N, -1.00 for a mismatch, and -2.00 for a 
# gap. Only single-base-pair gaps are allowed.

PRIMER_SELF_ANY=8


# PRIMER_MAX_END_STABILITY (float 999.9999, default 100.0)
# The maximum stability for the last five 3' bases of a left or right 
# primer.  Bigger numbers mean more stable 3' ends.  

PRIMER_MAX_END_STABILITY=100.0
